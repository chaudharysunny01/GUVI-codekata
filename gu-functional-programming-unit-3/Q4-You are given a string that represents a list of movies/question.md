You are given a string that represents a list of movies and their release years. The format of the string is "<movie title> (<release year>)". Write a Python function get_movies(data) that takes this string and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the movie title and the release year. Use regular expressions to parse the data.

Input:

data: a string representing a list of movies and their release years.
Output:

The function should return a list of tuples where each tuple contains a movie title and the release year.
Sample Input:

The Shawshank Redemption (1994), The Godfather (1972), The Dark Knight (2008)

Sample Output:

[('The Shawshank Redemption', '1994'), ('The Godfather', '1972'), ('The Dark Knight', '2008')]

Explanation:

The re.findall function applies the regular expression pattern to the data string and returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the movie title and the release year.
