You are given a string. Implement a function, is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool, to determine if the given string is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. Your function should return True if the string is a palindrome, and False otherwise.
